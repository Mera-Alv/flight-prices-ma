# flight-prices-ma
This project predicts flight airfare using key factors like travel duration, distance, and refundability, rather than the purchase date. Using PySpark, the dataset was cleaned and analyzed with linear regression. Key insights include the impact of seasonality and flight specifics on ticket prices.

# Goals of the Project
- Predict airfare based on flight-specific details.
- Analyze how various factors such as refundability, travel duration, and seasonality impact ticket prices.
- Build a linear regression model to make predictions and identify key insights.
- Visualize fare distribution and correlations between variables.
