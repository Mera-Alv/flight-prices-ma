# flight-prices-ma
This project predicts flight airfare using key factors like travel duration, distance, and refundability, rather than the purchase date. Using PySpark, the dataset was cleaned and analyzed with linear regression. Key insights include the impact of seasonality and flight specifics on ticket prices.

# File Descriptions
- **EDA Analysis.ipynb**: Performs exploratory data analysis with visualizations to understand the data and identify patterns.
- **Data Cleaning.ipynb**: Cleans the data by handling null values, transforming data types, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering & Visualizations.ipynb**: Engineers new features, creates final datasets for modeling, and visualizes key relationships in the data.

# Goals of the Project
- Predict airfare based on flight-specific details.
- Analyze how various factors such as refundability, travel duration, and seasonality impact ticket prices.
- Build a linear regression model to make predictions and identify key insights.
- Visualize fare distribution and correlations between variables.

# Run Notebooks in following order:
  - EDA Analysis.ipynb
